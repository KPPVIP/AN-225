Instructions [Add-On]:

1. Place the "an225" folder into [Gamefolder]\update\X64\dlcpacks\

2. With OpenIV, extract [Game folder]\update\update.rpf\common\data\dlclist.xml and edit this with Notepad++. Add the following entry:
		<Item>dlcpacks:\an225\</Item>

3. Now you are done, you will need a trainer with "spawn by name" function (Enhanced Native Trainer for example) to spawn the vehicle type in:

"an225"



I would advise using a Mods folder (more info at OpenIV) 
and make a backup, I take no responsibility if any shit happens.
